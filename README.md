The Airbrake iOS/Mac OS Notifier is designed to give developers instant notification of problems that occur in their apps. With just a few lines of code and a few extra files in your project, your app will automatically phone home whenever a crash or exception is encountered. These reports go straight to [Airbrake](http://airbrake.io) where you can see information like backtrace, device type, app version, and more.

To see how this might help you, check out [this screencast](http://guicocoa.com/airbrake). If you have questions or need support, please visit [Airbrake support](http://help.airbrake.io/discussions/ios-notifier)

The notifier requires iOS 5.0 or higher for iOS projects and Mac OS 10.7 or higher for Mac OS projects. It's also compitable with Swift. Current iOS Notifier version is 4.2.

# Signals

The notifier handles all unhandled exceptions, and a select list of Unix signals:

- `SIGABRT`
- `SIGBUS`
- `SIGFPE`
- `SIGILL`
- `SIGSEGV`
- `SIGTRAP`

# Symbolication

In order for the call stack to be properly symbolicated at the time of a crash, applications built with the notifier should not be stripped of their symbol information at compile time. If these settings are not set as  recommended, frames from your binary will be displayed as hex return addresses instead of readable strings. These hex return addresses can be symbolicated using `atos`. More information about symbolication and these build settings can be found in Apple's [developer documentation](http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/symbolizingcrashdumps.html). Here are the settings that control code stripping:

- Deployment Postprocessing: Off
- Strip Debug Symbols During Copy: Off
- Strip Linked Product: Off

# Versioning

Airbrake supports a version floor for reported notices. A setting called "Latest app version" is available in your project settings that lets you specify the lowest app version for which crashes will be saved. This version is compared using [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/). The notifier uses your `CFBundleVersion` to make this comparison. If you have apps in the wild that are using an older notifier version and don't report this bundle version, the notices will dropped by Airbrake. For more information on how this is implemented, read this [knowledge base article](http://help.airbrake.io/kb/ios/app-versions).

# Installation For Airbrake iOS
Directly from source code

1. Drag the Airbrake folder to your project and make sure "Copy Items" and "Create Groups" are selected
2. Add `SystemConfiguration.framework` to your project
3. Add 'CrashReporter.framework' from Airbrake folder to your project

From cocoapods

pod 'Airbrake-iOS', '~> 4.2.1'  

## Upgrading
Please remove all of the resources used by the notifier from your project before upgrading. This is the best way to make sure all of the appropriate files are present and no extra files exist.


# Find Your Project ID
With version 4.*, airbrake iOS also requires your Airbrake project ID . You can find your project ID from http://help.airbrake.io/kb/api-2/notifier-api-v3. 

# Running The Notifier in Swift
When you add Airbrake iOS to your Swift project, Xcode will automatically add the bridging header for 'ABNotifier' class. 

When Xcode didn't generate the bridging header for your project, for example, you installed Airbrake iOS from cocoapods, you can create a bridge file manually. 
1. Add a new file to the project and choose Header File as template  
2. Next, Save as [ProjectName]_Bridging_Header.h and make sure it's at the root of the project. 
3. Open [ProjectName]-Bridging-Header.h and add ABNotifier, for example
````objective-c
#ifndef [ProjectName]_Bridging_Header
#define [ProjectName]_Bridging_Header
#import "ABNotifier.h"
#endif
````
4. Add [ProjectName]_Bridging_Header.h to your project build settings. In your project build settings, find Swift Compiler â€“ Code Generation, and next to Objective-C Bridging Header add your bridging header file.
Now you should be able to access ABNotifier class in your swift project. 

First, set up the ABNotifer in your app delegate at the beginning of your 'func application(application: UIApplication!, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: NSDictionary!) -> Bool {'
````swift
ABNotifier.startNotifierWithAPIKey(YOUR_API_KEY, projectID: Your_Product_ID,environmentName: ABNotifierAutomaticEnvironment, useSSL: true);
````
    
# Running The Notifier in Objecitve C

The `ABNotifier` class is the primary class you will interact with while using the notifier. All of its methods and properties, along with the `ABNotifierDelegate` protocol are documented in their headers. **Please read through the header files for a complete reference of the library.**

To run the notifier you only need to complete two steps. First, import the `ABNotifier` header file in your app delegate

````objc
#import "ABNotifier.h"
````

Next, call the start notifier method at the very beginning of your `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`

````objective-c
[ABNotifier startNotifierWithAPIKey:@"YOUR_API_KEY"
                          projectID:@"Your_Product_ID"
                    environmentName:ABNotifierAutomaticEnvironment
                             useSSL:YES // only if your account supports it
                           delegate:self];
````

The API key argument expects your Airbrake project API key. The environment name you provide will be used to categorize received crash reports in the Airbrake web interface. The notifier provides several factory environment names that you are free to use.

- ABNotifierAutomaticEnvironment
- ABNotifierDevelopmentEnvironment
- ABNotifierAdHocEnvironment
- ABNotifierAppStoreEnvironment
- ABNotifierReleaseEnvironment


The `ABNotifierAutomaticEnvironment` environment will set the environment to release or development depending on the presence of the `DEBUG` macro.

# Environment Variables

Airbrake notices support custom environment variables. To add your own values to this part of the notice, use the "environmentValue" family of methods found in `ABNotifier.h`.

# Custom Exception Logging

You can log your own exceptions at any time.

````objective-c
@try {
    // something dangerous
}
@catch (NSException *e) {
    [ABNotifier logException:e];
}
````
When custom exception is used, the notifier will mirror the existing uncaught exception handler, and allow the application to catch and record exceptions without actually crashing. 


# Debugging

To test that the notifier is working inside your application, a simple test method is provided. This method raises an exception, catches it, and reports it as if a real crash happened. Add this code to your `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` to test the notifier:

````objective-c
[ABNotifier writeTestNotice];
````

Similarly you can call the test method in Swift. 
````swift
ABNotifier.writeTestNotice();
````
If you use the `DEBUG` macro to signify development builds the notifier will log notices and errors to the console as they are reported to help see more details.

#Implementing the Delegate Protocol

The `ABNotifierDelegate` protocol allows you to respond to actions going on inside the notifier as well as provide runtime customizations. As of version 3.0 of the notifier, a matching set of notifications are posted to `NSNotificationCenter`. All of the delegate methods in the `ABNotifierDelegate` protocol are documented in `ABNotifierDelegate.h`. Here are just a few of those methods:

**MyAppDelegate.h**

````objective-c
#import ABNotifier.h

@interface MyAppDelegate : NSObject <UIApplicationDelegate, ABNotifierDelegate>

// your properties and methods

@end
````

**MyAppDelegate.m**

````objective-c
@implementation MyAppDelegate
  
// your other methods

#pragma mark - notifier delegate
/*
  These are only a few of the delegate methods you can implement.
  The rest are documented in ABNotifierDelegate.h. All of the
  delegate methods are optional.
*/
- (void)notifierWillDisplayAlert {
  [gameController pause];
}
- (void)notifierDidDismissAlert {
  [gameController resume];
}
- (NSString *)titleForNoticeAlert {
  return @"Oh Noes!";
}
- (NSString *)bodyForNoticeAlert {
  return @"MyApp has detected unreported crashes, would you like to send a report to the developer?";
}
  
@end
````
