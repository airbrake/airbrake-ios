    <li>
      Drag the hoptoadnotifier, kissxml, and regexkitlite folders to your project
      <ul>
        <li>Make sure "Copy Items" and "Create Groups" are selected</li>
        <li>If you are already using kissxml or regexkitlite, you don't need to include them again</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Add SystemConfiguration.framework, libicucore.dylib, and libxml2.dylib to your project</li>
    <li>
      Add the path /usr/include/libxml2 to Header Search Paths in your project's build settings.
      <ul>
        <li>Make sure you add it under "All Configurations".</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Check the supported localizations of your App under your project settings
      <ul>
        <li>XCode will automaticly add all languages Airbreak notifier supports to the list of supported languages of your App. So you might want to delete some of them.</li>
      </ul>
  </ol>
  
  <h3>Running the notifier</h3>
  <p>Import the notifier header file</p>
  <pre>#import "HTNotifier.h"</pre>
  <p>Call the main notifier method at the very beginning of your <code>application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:</code></p>
  <pre>
[HTNotifier startNotifierWithAPIKey:(API KEY)
                    environmentName:HTNotifierDevelopmentEnvironment];
  </pre>

  <h3>Testing</h3>
  <p>To test that the notifier is working inside your application, a simple test method is provided. This method raises an exception, catches it, and reports it as if a real crash happened. Add this code to your `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` to test the notifier:</p>
  <pre>[[HTNotifier sharedNotifier] writeTestNotice];</pre>
